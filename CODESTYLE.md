For clean struct code good is using marks. 

```swift
class Example {

    // MARK: - Init
    
    init() {}
}
```

Here you find all which using in project.


- // MARK: - Init
- // MARK: - Ovveride
- // MARK: - Lifecycle
- // MARK: - Layout
- // MARK: - Helpers

If you can't find valid, add new to codestyle agreements please. Other can be use wit if class is large and need struct it even without adding to codestyle agreements.
